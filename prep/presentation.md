* Hook: Introduce a medical phenomenon that people often question, phantom vibration syndrome, which is a modern-day oddity caused by our brains being accustomed to expecting notifications that a sensation of vibration is signaled. Relate this idea to a futuristic or modern aspect of medicine, where we can apply modern solutions to a range of both newer and established cases. 

* Product: Demo of the simulation, explaining the simulation's context through a website.
   
* Process: Showing example demos from which we reused code and presenting key challenges through code snippets from past blogs, which we struggled with throughout the process of combining code. The code snippets would consists of code which relates to what we learned this year and the code which determines the main functionality of our simulation (specifically loops and conditional statements). When presenting the code, we would emphasize how we had to find connections between basic JS and Babylon JS to understand the function of our tool code.  

* Conclusion: Relating takeaways to the issues presented and how weâ€™ve utilized those takeaways outside of coding with real-life examples (like the skill portion of our blogs). The takeaways would include skills pertaining to correlation and organization as we had to specific code often throughout the project.
