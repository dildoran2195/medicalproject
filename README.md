# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Michaela Arendac & Dildora Norbekova**

## Context
We are students at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of our choosing.

For our project, we chose the topic of **medicine**. 

We used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. We also chose to independently study **Babylon** in order to help me make our website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* We were able to learn JavaScript components including arrays, conditionals, objects, etc.
* We were also able to learn Babylon components (more in depth JS) including the application of textures, meshes, shapes, etc.
* The project as a whole allowed us to reflect and improve upon primarily our organization and correlation skills which will better prepare us for future projects.   
##### CONS
* We weren't able to execute all of our intial visions including more machines and a gallery walk type of simulation due to continuous complications including our lacking knowledge on every Babylon attribute.
* Being that this project was a collaboration, we encountered many merging conflicts which ended up prolonging our scheduling.
