                        <p class="lead"> Last year, we focused on the general scope of medicine. We considered the past and just a slice of the future. This year, we recycled our initial prototype and dug deeper into its roots. How can we start building a foundation to save lives? </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Step 1: Revisit our original archetypes -Previously, we brainstormed several concepts including scanners, regeneration, robotics, and more (which you can read further into in our "Other Prototypes" section.) </li>
                            <li>Step 2: Determine key factors -A blood analyzer diagram in reality would have been an incredibly complex machine to build and formulate. We decided to focus on the fundamental parts as a way to get started. In short, this is just the beginning. </li>
                            <li>Step 3: The sky isn't the limit -To make our model potentially come to life some day, it is important for us to continously revisit our prototype and build upon it until it's no longer a prototype.</li>

                                    <h5>Advanced blood tester</h5>
                                        Last year, we focused on existing vs. future medical technology where we prioritized establishing a relationship between the past and present, while this year we solely focused on the future as a stitch in time saves nine.
                                        This is the particular technology which we're focusing on as of now. Why? Because blood is a key determinant in a person's overall health. By considering blood as a first step into the progression of medicine and technology, we'll be able to shift into other crucial prototypes. Currently, a common blood technology used in measuring blood activity, particularly blood pressure, is a blood pressure monitor. We built on this exisiting technology to create an improved version of this where the monitor will be able to measure other factors pertaining to blood using automation to complexify the process of anaylizing concentration, cell characterization, protein and hormonal levels, etc. This enhanced functionality aims to provide a more comprehensive snapshot of a person’s health in real time, minimizing the need for multiple separate tests and reducing delays in diagnosis. By integrating advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms, the device can continuously track and interpret various blood metrics, alerting users and healthcare providers to potential abnormalities instantly. This not only empowers individuals to take charge of their health but also supports doctors with more precise and up-to-date data, ultimately contributing to faster intervention and more personalized treatment plans.

                                        <h3>Other Prototypes Further Down the Road</h3>

                                        <h5> In the future... </h5> ...medical machines are expected to become significantly more intelligent, adaptive, and interconnected, transforming the way healthcare is delivered. These advanced systems will likely be capable of analyzing vast amounts of health data in real time, identifying patterns and anomalies that would be impossible for humans to detect alone. With improved automation and precision, they will support earlier diagnosis, more accurate monitoring, and personalized treatment plans tailored to each individual's unique health profile. The integration of these technologies into everyday care could lead to a more proactive and preventative healthcare model, reducing hospital visits, minimizing human error, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes on a global scale.


                                        <h5>Diagnostic body scanner</h5>
                                        MRI technology is essentially a body scanner, however, the machine has potential risks including magnetic field and radio frequency risk. Additionally, the scans are not covered when they are not medically necessary. I want to create a body scanner which is guaranteed to be safe and inexpensive to use.
                                        <h5>Tissue regeneration technology</h5>
                                        There is currently medicine which is associated with faster and efficient healing. I want to expand on this technology and compile a system of devices to create a regenerative machine which can be used in critical conditions.
                                        <h5>Chemical imbalance medicine</h5>
                                        I want to expand on medicine which exists to balance chemicals in the brain. Mental issues take up a majority of the world and to research more efficient medical alternatives would naturally lessen the effect.
                                        <h5>Artificial 3d organ printers</h5>
                                        These printers would be able to create functioning organs in replacement of damaged ones at a faster rate.
                                        <h5>Robotics</h5>
                                        Robots are commonly used in manufacturing, packaging, transport, exploration, surgery, weaponry, research, safety, etc.
                                        Health wise, robots can be used to perform a human’s job at a more efficient and faster rate
                                        This could speed up healing process in patients the same way the other listed technologies are able to
                                        Robotics essentially combines all the guidelines associated with healthcare making this field  and its technology greatly in demand in regards to successful regeneration.

                        <p class="lead"> This is what a blood testing machine could potentially look like. The advanced blood analyzer machine we’re developing builds upon traditional blood pressure monitors by incorporating a suite of sensors and intelligent systems designed to capture and interpret a wide range of biological data from a single blood sample or continuous monitoring. Unlike standard devices that only measure systolic and diastolic pressure, this analyzer uses microfluidic technology to process blood in small volumes with high precision. It integrates biosensors capable of detecting and quantifying biomarkers such as glucose, cholesterol, hormones, and proteins, along with indicators of inflammation, oxygen saturation, and even early signs of disease. </p>
