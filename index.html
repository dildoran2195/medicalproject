                        <p class="lead"> Last year, we focused on the general scope of medicine. We considered the past and just a slice of the future. This year, we recycled our initial prototype and dug deeper into its roots. How can we start building a foundation to save lives? </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Step 1: Revisit our original archetypes -Previously, we brainstormed several concepts including scanners, regeneration, robotics, and more (which you can read further into in our "Other Prototypes" section.) </li>
                            <li>Step 2: Determine key factors -A blood analyzer diagram in reality would have been an incredibly complex machine to build and formulate. We decided to focus on the fundamental parts as a way to get started. In short, this is just the beginning. </li>
                            <li>Step 3: The sky isn't the limit -To make our model potentially come to life some day, it is important for us to continously revisit our prototype and build upon it until it's no longer a prototype.</li>

                                        <h5>Advanced blood tester</h5>
                                        This is the particular technology which we're focusing on as of now. Why? Because blood is a key determinant in a person's overall health. By considering blood as a first step into the progression of medicine and technology, we'll be able to shift into other crucial prototypes. Currently, a common blood technology used in measuring blood activity, particularly blood pressure, is a blood pressure monitor. We built on this exisiting technology to create an improved version of this where the monitor will be able to measure other factors pertaining to blood using automation to complexify the process of anaylizing concentration, cell characterization, protein and hormonal levels, etc.

                                        <h3>Other Prototypes</h3>


                                        <h5>Diagnostic body scanner</h5>
                                        MRI technology is essentially a body scanner, however, the machine has potential risks including magnetic field and radio frequency risk. Additionally, the scans are not covered when they are not medically necessary. I want to create a body scanner which is guaranteed to be safe and inexpensive to use.
                                        <h5>Tissue regeneration technology</h5>
                                        There is currently medicine which is associated with faster and efficient healing. I want to expand on this technology and compile a system of devices to create a regenerative machine which can be used in critical conditions.
                                        <h5>Chemical imbalance medicine</h5>
                                        I want to expand on medicine which exists to balance chemicals in the brain. Mental issues take up a majority of the world and to research more efficient medical alternatives would naturally lessen the effect.
                                        <h5>Artificial 3d organ printers</h5>
                                        These printers would be able to create functioning organs in replacement of damaged ones at a faster rate.
                                        <h5>Robotics</h5>
                                        Robots are commonly used in manufacturing, packaging, transport, exploration, surgery, weaponry, research, safety, etc.
                                        Health wise, robots can be used to perform a human’s job at a more efficient and faster rate
                                        This could speed up healing process in patients the same way the other listed technologies are able to
                                        Robotics essentially combines all the guidelines associated with healthcare making this field  and its technology greatly in demand in regards to successful regeneration.
